# FullStackCarPartMGMTSystem
A full-stack Car Parts Order Management System built in C and React.   Features modular backend (C), SQLite database, REST API, web frontend, and UML documentation.  

****

The Car Parts Order Management System is a full-stack project designed to showcase software engineering and system design skills.  
Originally developed as a C programming assignment, it has been refactored into a professional, modular application with:  

- A C backend with separate modules for inventory, orders, database access, and utilities  
- Data persistence through CSV (Semester 1) and SQLite (Semester 2)  
- A REST API exposing backend functionality  
- A React-based web frontend for user interaction  
- UML, ER, and architecture diagrams documenting the design  
- CI/CD pipeline, containerization, and deployment (Semester 2)  

This project demonstrates end-to-end development ability, from low-level C data structures and algorithms to modern full-stack application design.
